### NightShiftPatcher

- Original idea by [Pike](https://pikeralpha.wordpress.com/2017/01/30/4398)
- Based on [NightPatch](https://github.com/pookjw/NightPatch) from @pookjw

Just [disable SIP](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection.html)[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Integrity_Protection), and execute ***NightShiftPatcher.sh*** script with superuser privileges (using [sudo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo), for example)
